Frizzly allows you to add share buttons on images and in post content.

== Description ==
If you use many different plugins to add social media share buttons to your website, most likely each plugin has its own images and your website looks inconsistent. Frizzly is here to fix that. Frizzly allows you to share your posts on multiple social networks: Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Linkedin and more. You can easily choose on which pages the share buttons should show up and where they should be placed.

Features:

* add share icons before and after the content of your posts
* add share icons over images (especially useful for websites that use images extensively)
* choose only share buttons that you need
* don't show share buttons on certain pages (e.g. your home page)
